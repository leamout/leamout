# Enterprise capability boundaries

Enterprise is optional commercial packaging for Leamout Self-Hosted or
Leamout Cloud. It is not a deployment model, separate control plane, or runtime
architecture. Enterprise capabilities use the same organization, application,
Media Runtime, and Agent Runtime boundaries as every other Leamout deployment.

## Package ownership

Enterprise-capable product work belongs to the domain that owns the behavior:

```text
server/internal/
├── security/
│   ├── sso/             enterprise identity-provider connections
│   ├── scim/            directory provisioning for users and groups
│   └── authz/           roles, permissions, scopes, and authorization policy
└── platform/
    ├── entitlements/    organization capability availability
    ├── retention/       organization retention policy and cleanup jobs
    └── networking/      organization-level network access configuration
```

Packages are added when their behavior is implemented; empty scaffolding is
not architecture. A package adds only the files required by its active
responsibilities:

| File | Add it when |
| --- | --- |
| `model.go` | The module defines domain models, states, errors, commands, inputs, or outputs. |
| `repository.go` | The module owns durable persistence or database queries. |
| `service.go` | The module contains business rules, use cases, orchestration, or transaction boundaries. |
| `validation.go` | The module has reusable domain or input validation. |
| `handler.go` | The module exposes HTTP endpoints. |
| `routes.go` | The module registers HTTP routes, normally together with `handler.go`. |
| `consumer.go` | Events enter the module asynchronously. |
| `publisher.go` | Events leave the module asynchronously. |
| `jobs.go` | The module owns scheduled or recurring background work. |

Existing packages do not need mechanical file renames when their current files
already express these responsibilities clearly. In particular,
`security/authz` remains the shared authorization domain rather than an
Enterprise-only duplicate.

## Entitlements

`platform/entitlements` answers whether an organization may use an optional
capability. Initial capability identifiers are SSO, SCIM, advanced RBAC,
retention policies, and private networking.

An entitlement is organization scoped and deployment neutral:

```text
Organization
    |
    +-- capability entitlement
            |
            +-- security/sso
            +-- security/scim
            +-- security/authz
            +-- platform/retention
            +-- platform/networking
```

An entitlement is not a subscription, invoice, pricing tier, deployment mode,
or runtime-fleet assignment. Commercial systems may grant or revoke it, but
feature modules consume only the capability decision. Self-Hosted and Cloud
therefore use the same checks and domain model.

Entitlements default to disabled when no organization row exists. This avoids
accidentally enabling commercial or security-sensitive behavior. Capability
modules must still perform their own authorization and tenant-scope checks;
an entitlement never replaces authorization.

## PostgreSQL ownership

Enterprise-capability state remains ordinary organization-scoped application
state in PostgreSQL:

```text
PostgreSQL
├── Enterprise access
│   ├── entitlements
│   ├── sso_connections
│   ├── scim_tokens
│   └── scim_identities
├── Retention
│   └── retention_policies
└── Networking
    └── network_policies
```

- `entitlements` records which optional capabilities an organization may use.
- `sso_connections` stores organization SAML or OIDC configuration. Secret
  material is ciphertext; list queries intentionally omit it.
- `scim_tokens` stores only hashes of credentials presented by external SCIM
  clients. Plaintext bearer tokens are never persisted.
- `scim_identities` maps external directory identifiers to Leamout users in
  the same organization.
- `retention_policies` stores per-resource retention periods for an
  organization.
- `network_policies` stores organization-level source-network access rules.

All normal reads and writes are scoped by `organization_id`. Authentication by
token hash is the deliberate exception for locating a SCIM principal; the
resolved token still carries its owning organization into subsequent access.
These tables contain configuration and access state, not subscription billing
or a parallel Enterprise control plane.

## Capability modules

### `security/sso`

Owns organization identity-provider connections and SAML/OIDC login behavior.
Provider secrets and signing material must be encrypted and tenant scoped.

### `security/scim`

Owns directory provisioning for organization users and groups. SCIM bearer
credentials belong to this security boundary and must not be exposed by normal
API responses.

### `security/authz`

Owns roles, permissions, credential scopes, policies, and request guards. The
existing package is shared across all product packaging; advanced RBAC extends
it without creating a parallel Enterprise authorization stack.

### `platform/retention`

Owns organization retention policies and scheduled cleanup work. Retention
deletion must respect existing recording-storage ownership and tenant
isolation.

Recording retention cleanup selects only completed recordings older than the
organization's configured cutoff. It delegates deletion to the recording
service rather than deleting rows directly, so the object is removed from its
pinned Leamout-managed or organization BYOS destination before metadata is
marked deleted. A storage deletion failure stops the cleanup batch and leaves
the recording metadata intact for a later retry.

### `platform/networking`

Owns organization-level network access configuration. It must not introduce a
private runtime fleet, runtime registration, or deployment-mode branching.

Active policies are enforced after authentication and organization resolution.
A matching deny rule takes precedence over every allow rule. When at least one
active allow rule exists, unmatched addresses are denied; with deny-only or no
active rules, unmatched addresses are allowed. Disabled rules are ignored.

The direct socket peer is the request source unless it belongs to an
operator-configured `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` range. Only then may Leamout walk the
`X-Forwarded-For` chain from right to left to find the first untrusted client
address. Forwarding headers from untrusted peers are ignored.
